                                If you are willing to adventure a bit out of the way from some of the other major attractions that Yosemite has to offer, I advise you to visit what is called the Mariposa Grove. This is located in the southern part of Yosemite park and is home to many giant sequoia trees that are hundreds if not over a thousand years old. The grove is surrounded by hundreds of years of history with many trees having their own unique story. Once at the grove youâ€™ll find yourself amid an almost fantasy like forest you would think to only see in the movies. It is definitely one that you want to put on your bucket list.

                                This is by far my favorite viewpoint of all. On a clear day, being at Glacier Point, you can see for miles across a beautiful landscape that is impossible to be replicated by mankind. One will be sure to feel very small and insignificant when peering out in the distance while here. This location is a must see because it is truly a humbling experience.

                                This is one of my favorite locations because it really captures the raw and natural beauty that mother nature can provide. Located a bit further west from El Capitan is where you can find this majestic waterfall in all its glory. The waterfall stands at a height of 617 feet and can be accessed through the Bridalveil Fall Trail.

                                El Capitan is a massive 7,569 foot vertical rock formation located in the western part of the park. The rock is made up of mostly granite not unlike many other features in Yosemite. The easiest way to get to a close-up view to El Capitan is to go to what is called The Base of the Nose and then take the El Capitan Trail for a breath-taking view at this behemoth. <br><span id = "fun-fact">Fun Fact:</span> Just recently in June 2017, a free climber named Alex Honnold solo climbed El Capitan in an astonishing 3 hours and 56 minutes.
