                                Similar to whenever any new location is discovered, there are always the people that resided at the location long before any documentation was written. In the case of Yosemite, these people happened to be the American Indians that used the area for hunting and gathering purposes. There are still descendants of these Indians, known as the Sierra Miwok, that are living in Yosemite to this day. Fast forward to around the mid 1800â€™s, the discovery of gold in California incited opportunity and with opportunity, comes people. From this new influx of frontiersmen and explorers, there were many conflicts involving land and resources that often erupted into violence. Amidst the bloody Civil War that was raging in the U.S, President Abraham Lincoln signed a grant in 1864 that gave Yosemite full protection from being consumed for resources. Yosemite was one of the first ever areas to be issued immunity based on scenic beauty and for public enjoyment. Yosemite was officially recognized as a National Park in 1890.
