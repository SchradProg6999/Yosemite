                            <p>In and around Yosemite National Park, there are plenty of great places to stay. Depending on your budget you could spend anywhere between $50-$800 a night at Yosemite. Of course, the closer you are to the main attractions like Yosemite Valley, the more expensive lodging is going to be. The one place that I was lucky enough to stay at was called the Yosemite Valley Lodge inside Yosemite Village. I highly recommend this location because it is moderately priced for around $150-$200 a night for two adults and is one of the prime locations where many gorgeous views are only a few minutes away.
                            In addition to the prime location of this lodge, there is a great restaurant right next door called the Mountain Room Restaurant and Lodge which serves a lavish array of seafood and steaks.</p>

                            <p>This campground is a great site to stay during your visit at Yosemite, especially if you don’t mind the outdoors. For around $90, you are afforded with a few creature comforts including, a twin and double bed, campfire, bearproof storage locker, and electrical outlets. For the price, the location is still top notch if you are looking for easy access to many features the park has to offer. The only downside to this location is that it is not open year round and only operational between April and October.</p>
