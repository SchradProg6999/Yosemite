                            <p>This is the place where I ate most of my meals considering it was one of the cheaper options around and I couldn’t afford to eat out at the nicer restaurants three times a day. It was a nice stop in the middle of the day between attractions to get a quick bite to eat. This food court has a variety of the “feel good” foods we all eat on occasion or if you’re like me…all the time! They have a variety of options ranging from pizza to mac & cheese to really good burgers with all the fixin’s. Also, they do offer healthier options such as steamed vegetables, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, and fish as well. If you are staying anywhere in the immediate area, you are almost certainly going to find yourself here.</p>

                            <p>If you are looking for a nice place to take the family, your significant other, or to simply crack open a cold one at the bar, this place has you covered. The Mountain Room Restaurant is an upscale restaurant of modern yet rustic design. The wooden interior sports a very comfortable space with low light levels yet boasts cathedral ceilings, giving the restaurant a larger overall feel. Although the Mountain Room is only open for dinner, it still boasts very refined and mastered dishes such as the filet mignon (my personal favorite), pan roasted rainbow trout, and the house smoked salmon to name a few. These meals are often paired with the Mountain Room’s wide array of cocktails and wines that are available. The prices are a bit on the higher side than you may be used to but the food, atmosphere, and experience are definitely worth it. In addition to the sleek design and delectable food options, this restaurant offers an alluring view of Yosemite Falls off in the distance.
