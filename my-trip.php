                                It was a dimly light, dewy Sunday morning when I arrived at the airport in Buffalo, New York. I recall observing the moisture in the air, hoping that the weather would hold off a bit longer as to not delay my flight to Yosemite National Park. As I checked my bags in through security I notice the smell of coffee being brewed at The Coffee Beanery. I’m a sucker for coffee so the smell was all it took to get me in that line and order a fresh brewed cup of morning greatness. Shortly after obtaining my coffee, I went to find my flight’s gate. When I arrived, I noticed there weren’t many people in the waiting area. That didn’t bother me much though as I took solace in knowing that at least the airplane was going to have a few empty seats. I thought “Hmm, maybe I’ll be able to be in a row all to myself!”. I very much dislike sitting next to people on the airplane as I’m partially a germaphobe so airplanes kind of freak me out. Long story short… I didn’t get to have my own row.

                                Fast forward to California! (The airplane ride was quite stale and uneventful.) Once my flight landed in Fresno, California, I hurried my way to the bus loading area and took the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (YARTS) from Fresno all the way to Yosemite Valley. Even though the bus ride was around two and half hours, it gave you a preview of what was in store for you when you finally arrived at your destination, which I thought was awesome. Conveniently, the bus route went right past the Yosemite Valley Lodge which was going to be my home for the next few days. I had conjured up quite the appetite during the bus route so I hastily checked in and went to my room to drop off my luggage. The place I ate at was called the Yosemite Lodge Food Court. Little did I know, this was the place where I was going to be eating the most of my meals.

                                So, being the person who goes on an adventure with no plan on how to efficiently see everything Yosemite has to offer, I was at quite the crossroads when attempting to decide where I wanted to go first. I eventually decided to head up towards the upper portion of Yosemite Falls since that was the closest attraction to me upon arriving. It was a couple mile hike to the top taking the Yosemite Falls Trailhead but I eventually made it towards the top. It was worth the hike because the view from the top was astonishing. Since I had been travelling a lot in the first day, I called it quits since the hike was challenging and travelling generally just tires me out. The next day I planned to see the Bridal Veil Falls, El Capitan, and Glacier Point. I woke up early on the second day as to give myself enough time to see all three attractions that I had planned the day prior. I first headed for Glacier Point, which looking back on it now, it was a terrible first adventure as the trail was a whopping four miles uphill just to get to the viewpoint. Once I was at the top, it was one of the most beautiful views I’ve seen in my entire life. It was almost as if you could see so far that you would think the earth was a flat expansion for hundreds of miles. Needless to say, I took a shuttle back into the valley and I was able to stop by Bridalveil Fall and El Capitan on the way back. These places weren’t as crazy of a walk to gain access to. Bridalveil Fall was a short walk right off the road from where I originally came in to the park and El Capitan was another short walk in the opposite direction. After another successful day of seeing the sights, I had dinner at the Mountain Room Restaurant & Lounge where I ordered the Filet Mignon mid-rare. On the third day, it was time for me to leave the valley to catch my flight that wasn’t until later in the evening so I had some time to see a couple more attractions on my way out. I’d looked up what was called the Tunnel View in Yosemite National Park because it one of the more famous spots for people to take pictures and I figured it was a great sight to see on my way out of the park. The other place that I wanted to check out before I left were the famous giant sequoias in Mariposa Grove. Sadly, I heard that Mariposa Grove was closed at the time that I wanted to see it and I didn’t have enough to time to wait for it to open because my flight was leaving that night.

                                I arrived back in Fresno with enough time to get through security at the airport and make it to my gate on time. I had a quick bite to eat somewhere in the airport but the name of the place escapes me. What I ordered was nothing special, just your average turkey club sandwich and a coke in case you were wondering. My only regret from my trip was not being able to get a rental car for my mini vacation. I was not old enough at the time. Constantly looking at shuttle times was a little stressful but it would have been much easier if I had my own car. If you are old enough to obtain a rental car, I highly suggest you do.
