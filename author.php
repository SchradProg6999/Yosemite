                            Hello there! I included this page for anyone who wanted to know a bit more about myself as I do sometimes enjoy reading a little blurb about the author before or after I read a book. That picture to the right is (you guessed it) me of course. I grew up in a small town south of Buffalo, New York and graduated high school in 2011. I attended college for a semester before leaving to join the military. Over the next few years I was stationed in Fairbanks, Alaska and I grew to love the outdoors and what nature had to offer. Shortly after getting out of the military I took a long drive from Fairbanks all the way back home to Buffalo. I heard about Yosemite National Park at the time when I was taking my long road trip across the continental U.S. but it was too far out of the way to justify going. I then planned a trip to go back to California and see the wonders that were in Yosemite and it quickly became one of my favorite places that I have ever travelled to in my life.
